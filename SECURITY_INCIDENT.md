# 🚨 Security Incident Report

## What Happened

On **October 27, 2025 at 1:20 AM**, the file `appsettings.json` containing sensitive configuration data was accidentally committed and pushed to the repository.

## Immediate Actions Taken

✅ **Force-pushed** to remove the commit containing sensitive data  
✅ **Added** `appsettings.json` to `.gitignore`  
✅ **Removed** `appsettings.json` from Git tracking  
✅ **Created** `appsettings.example.json` as a safe template  

## What Was Exposed (Potentially)

The exposed file may have contained:
- Database connection strings
- Email SMTP credentials
- Google OAuth Client ID
- JWT configuration paths

## Required Actions

### 🔴 **IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Change all passwords and credentials** that were in `appsettings.json`:
   - Email password (generate new App Password)
   - Database password (if applicable)
   - Rotate Google OAuth Client Secret (if exists)

2. **Regenerate JWT RSA Keys:**
   ```bash
   cd KeyGenerator
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Review GitHub access:**
   - Check repository access logs
   - Review who has access to the repository

### 🟡 **AS SOON AS POSSIBLE:**

1. **Create your own `appsettings.json`:**
   ```bash
   cp LinkShortener.Api/appsettings.example.json LinkShortener.Api/appsettings.json
   ```

2. **Fill in your NEW credentials** (not the old ones)

3. **Verify `.gitignore` is working:**
   ```bash
   git status  # appsettings.json should NOT appear
   ```

## Prevention Measures

- ✅ `appsettings.json` now in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `appsettings.example.json` created as safe template
- ✅ Documentation updated
- 📝 TODO: Consider using Azure Key Vault or similar for production
